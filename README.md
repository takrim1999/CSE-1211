# CSE-1292

## This is where i push all of my assignments of my CSE-1292 course.It can be useful for you if you want ideas.

### There I'm writting some algorithms to complete programs in lab exams.

- You must take input with white spaces for example, "Hello World", this string must be totally taken and stored in any variable.
[you can see this in my personal exercise]
- You must do some number count, like how many numbers there can be from 1 to 10
- You must be able to slice a string and compare it with any character.
- As you can slice string from previous point, you should be able to count frequencies of character, (with whitespace, and it's very important)
